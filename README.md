},

#### How to obtain your token

https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token

#### Known issues

* `error unmarshalling READY event` is not a problem, it just happens because you're doing a self bot
* `Already purchased` happens when the gift is a Xbox game pass plan, so if you already activated a discord game pass
  code you can't activate it anymore
* It looks like Discord added a security feature where your token change every time but also expire with 2FA, that might
  be the reason why the sniper doesn't work after some time or if you get an unauthorized error when sniping Nitro
* Some welcome bots mention giveaways that might cause a false positive
* Privnote sniper makes the program crash sometimes, disable it in settings if that happens to you until I find a
  solution

#### Disclaimer

This is against TOS and can get your account banned, especially if you run multiple instance at the same time and/or
claim too many Nitros in a too short amount of time. Use it at your own risks.
